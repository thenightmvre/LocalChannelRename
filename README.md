# Local Channel Rename

A BetterDiscord plugin that allows you to locally rename Discord channels for a personalized experience.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Persistent Renaming**: Rename channels locally - changes persist across Discord restarts
- **Settings Panel**: Easy-to-use settings interface to manage all your channel renames
- **Real-time Updates**: Channel names update immediately when added/modified
- **Safe & Local**: All changes are stored locally and don't affect the actual Discord servers


## üì¶ Installation

1. Download `LocalChannelRename.plugin.js` from the [Releases](https://github.com/thenightmvre/LocalChannelRename/releases/tag/DiscordPlugin) page
2. Place the file in your BetterDiscord plugins folder:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\BetterDiscord\plugins\`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/BetterDiscord/plugins/`
   - Linux: `~/.config/BetterDiscord/plugins/`
3. Restart Discord or reload BetterDiscord (Ctrl+R)
4. Enable the plugin in BetterDiscord settings


## üöÄ Usage

### Adding Channel Renames

1. Open BetterDiscord Settings (Ctrl+,)
2. Navigate to Plugins ‚Üí LocalChannelRename
3. Click the settings button next to the plugin
4. In the "Add New Rename" section:
   - Enter the Channel ID (right-click channel ‚Üí Copy ID)
   - Enter your desired custom name
   - Click "Add Rename"

### Managing Renames

- **View Current Renames**: See all your configured renames in the settings panel
- **Remove Renames**: Click the "Remove" button next to any rename to delete it
- **Edit Renames**: Remove the old one and add a new one with the updated name

### Finding Channel IDs

To get a channel's ID:
1. Enable Developer Mode in Discord (User Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Developer Mode)
2. Right-click on any channel
3. Select "Copy ID"


## üîß How It Works

The plugin uses DOM manipulation to change how channel names are displayed in your Discord client. The actual channel names on Discord servers remain unchanged - this is purely a local visual modification.
